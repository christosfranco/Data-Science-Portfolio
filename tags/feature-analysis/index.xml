      <description>Principal component analysis: Some few tool to analyze the specific impact of each feature, and their impact on the label. The tool is applied to a dataset of flowers, where we try to classify which features of the plant correspond to the specific flower.
PCA We only have 4 features in this dataset, so PCA will not be as effective in emiting unneeded features. But if we would have had a far larger dataset with many more features, the calculations we would normally have to do can be widely reduced by the use of PCA.</description>
